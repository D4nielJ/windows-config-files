A powerful Windows terminal configuration script that automates the setup of your development environment. This is a highly opinionated script that will install all the tools I use on a daily basis during development on windows. You can customize it to your liking by editing the script or take it as a starting point to build your own.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 7+ (Windows PowerShell 5.1 is not supported)
- Internet connection

## Installation

```powershell
# Install latest powershell update
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

```powershell
# Re-open powershell and run the script.
$scriptUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D4nielJ/windows-config-files/refs/heads/main/.dotfiles/dtermin4l.ps1"
iex (irm $scriptUrl)

# Reset the terminal once more and run
Sync-TerminalSettings
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Make sure to backup your existing terminal settings.json as it will be replaced by the settings from /.config/terminal/settings.json

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-Installation Usage

### Dotfiles Management

After installation, you can manage your dotfiles using the `dt` alias (shorthand for `dotfiles`):

```powershell
dt status              # Check status of your dotfiles
dt add route/to/file   # Add files you want to track
dt commit -m "message" # Commit changes
dt push               # Push changes to remote
dt pull               # Pull latest changes
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Never use `dt add .` in your home directory! Since this is a bare repository, it will try to track all files in your home directory. Instead, explicitly add the files you want to track: `dt add ~/.config/specific-file`
